# NNDL_Kaggle
This is the project for NNDL class competition assignment

##Objective:
The objective of this project is to train images in the given dataset and predict superclass and subclass of an image.
One of the key aspects in this project is that, while testing the model, the model needs to predict unseen subclasses from the training data.

##Dataset:
The training dataset in the competition consists of 6.4K images of resolution 8x8x3 and spread over
3 super classes and 89 sub classes. Similarly, the test dataset contains about 9.1K images belonging
to the same 3 super classes, but some of them belong to sub classes not present in the training dataset.
Also, there is an imbalance in the number of samples for each sub class(50 or 100) in the training
dataset.

###Approach:
